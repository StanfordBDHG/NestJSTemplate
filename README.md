# TypeScript Template

## How To Use This Template

The template repository contains a template TypeScript Project.

Follow these steps to customize it to your needs:

1. Rename the TypeScript project.

## Getting Started

You can run the project using the following command. You will need to install Node.js and npm, e.g., using [homebrew (recommended for macOS)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node) or the official [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
2. Build the image and run the docker compose setup: `docker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up`.

You can view your images created with `docker images`.

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result. You can visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the reverse proxy setup before the main application.

The `docker-compose.yml` setup contains a production-ready setup using a reverse proxy.
